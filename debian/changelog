nbis (4.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

   * Initial release (Closes: #12)
   * added line that substitutes appropriate buildutil path into 
   p_rules.mak files
   * tilde_filename: collapsed add_path=2 option into add_path=1; i.e. 
   now tilde_filename always substitutes the installed runtime data 
   dir (if no tilde expansion is required)
   * added source code files formerly created by setup.sh (via sed 
   substitution from XXX.c.src to XXX.c)
   * added rules.mak, which was formerly generated by setup.sh; this 
   is now a static version
   * removed unnecessary imaging library directories (ijg, jpeg2k, png, 
   openjpeg)
   * generated p_rules.mak files from p_rules.mak.src, eliminating 
   need for that step in make config target
   * removed make target dependence on libopenjpeg.a and libpng.a
   * corrected openjpeg #include directive
   * replaced sed substitution with preprecessor #define for runtime 
   data directory paths (in an2k, pcasys, etc.)
   * Makefile: removed install and catalog dependencies from all 
   target divided install target into dependencies -mkdirs, 
   -runtimedata, -headers, -libnbis, -bins removed cruft relating to 
   jpeg2k, png, and openjpg packages from install-headers replaced 
   usages of FINAL_INSTALLATION_DIR with new INSTALL_ROOT_XXX_DIR 
   convention
   * rules.mak: using auto-detection of top-level directory via 
   MAKEFILE_LIST; eliminated obsolete variables; added stuff to CFLAGS
   to define runtime data directories (e.g. for an2k, pcasys); added 
   openjpeg and png libraries to LDFLAGS
   * .gitignore: added stuff that make generates to ignore list
   * Makefile: split install-mkdirs up into relevant targets; removed 
   -headers and -libnbis from install target dependencies (because 
   these would be more appropriate in a libnbis-dev package; added 
   statement to install ijg binaries that were previously missing
   * removed obsolete makefile inputs and outdated install instructions
   * modified install target to fix permissions on manual and runtime 
   data files
   * improved clean target to catch remaining *.d files and 
   bin/obj/lib directories, as well as exports and doc/catalogs
   * added apache license header to files that differ from upstream
   * moved LDFLAGS to near end of gcc command, before output 
   specification
   * added deb hardening environment variables (issue #3)
   * removed obsolete third-party makefile rules
   * fixed spelling error (completly instead of completely) 
   (issue #2); removed obsolete select.c.xxx files
   * fixed spelling error in manpages chkan2k.1 and pcasys.1 
   (issue #8)
   * removed references to jpegb (issue #4); this (unfortunately) 
   removes support for JPEG-Baseline, a popular image format, but the 
   lintian error (tag embedded-library) would have caused a build 
   failure on Launchpad
   * fixed spelling errors in chkan2k.1, pcasys.1, nfiq.c
   * added debian watch file
   * replaced bad groff_man macros with alternatives; not sure what 
   original meaning was in all cases, but this should resolve most of 
   issue #10 (except for the error regarding record_selector.1)
   * added missing man pages for dlwsqcom and optrwsgw (issue #6)
   * replaced 1[ABCDEFG] with 1 to resolve manpage section mismatches 
   (issue #5)
   * restricted man page installation to binaries that get installed 
   (instead of everything from the man/man1 source directory)
   * removed verbose echo statements from clean targets
